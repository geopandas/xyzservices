This script takes both provider sources stored in `provider_sources`, removes items
which do not represent actual providers (metadata from leaflet-providers-parsed and
templates from xyzservices-providers), combines them together and saves as a compressed
JSON to data/providers.json.

The compressed JSON is shipped with the package.
